# Vue-githubRepoFetch

A web application created to fetch the github repositories of users, built with vuejs and using the Github API

In this project, I implemented a client-side application using the Vue JavaScript library and the vue-router-dom library for routing.

To retrieve data from the GitHub API, I implemented an API call using the fetch call. The API call was used to fetch my user profile and repository data, which was then displayed on the “repositories page” using a card UI. Each card displayed the repository title, language, and a button to view more details about the repository.
